# HYPERMarketNFT P2P

A decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace for NFT artists and collectors that runs completely on your local machine.

## 🔗 Project Link

**Repository:** https://github.com/dustinAI/nfthypermarket

## 📖 Description

This DApp was originally intended to be a web application, but I realized during development that a centralized approach wouldn't work well for what I envisioned. Instead, it's now designed as a peer-to-peer marketplace that each user runs locally on their own machine via localhost.  http: // 127.0.0.1 : PORT

## ⚠️ Important

This project is **not built on Pear**, but it runs locally and privately on your machine — no servers or centralized backend. You control your own environment.

## 🛠️ How to Run It

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Pear globally** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install -g pear
   ```

### Installation

2. **Clone this repo and navigate into it**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dustinAI/nfthypermarket
   cd NFTHyperMarket
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the local server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js store1
   ```

Once started, the app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:PORT` on your local machine.

## 🔐 Wallet & Seed Phrase Warning

- **The initial peer node** (the one running `store1`) can use a fresh new wallet — it acts only as an operator.

- **When using the local DApp**, you must use the correct seed phrase linked to your HYPERTOKENS wallet.

- This is where your TAP tokens will be sent from, and the wallet must match the sender address expected by the system.

### ✅ Important Verification

**Please double-check your seed phrase and wallet address before sending any TAP tokens.** Funds will only be credited if the wallet matches exactly.

### 🎯 Official HYPERMARKET Wallet

The official HYPERMARKET wallet is this. You need to send here and only here from HYPERTOKENS:

```

## 🎨 About the Project

I'm not a professional developer — I'm an NFT artist — but I built this with a lot of passion and effort so artists and collectors can have a decentralized way to connect and trade, peer-to-peer.

Even though it's not perfect or built with Pear natively, I hope you'll give it a try and see the vision behind it.
